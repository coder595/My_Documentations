# üìù Neovim Commenting Guide with `vim-commentary`

This guide explains how to use **[tpope/vim-commentary](https://github.com/tpope/vim-commentary)** for commenting code in Neovim.  
It uses the same logic as other Vim operators (`d` delete, `y` yank):  
- `gc` is the **operator** (comment)  
- `{motion}` is **what** you apply it to
